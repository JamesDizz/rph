            <h2>Brgy. Gabi</h2>
            <p>The origin of Barangay Gabi in San Jose Patron, Cordova, Cebu, likely dates back to the pre-colonial era of the Philippines. Like many other barangays in the country, Gabi may have been originally inhabited by indigenous communities whose livelihoods were primarily based on agriculture, fishing, and trade.
                With the arrival of Spanish colonizers in the Philippines in the 16th century, the landscape and culture of the region underwent significant changes. Spanish missionaries established Catholic missions and converted the local population to Christianity. It's possible that during this time, the area that is now Barangay Gabi came under the influence of Catholicism, with the construction of churches, chapels, and other religious structures. And the baranggay gabi originates from the gabi plant.( based from the sk chairman)
